          <h3> "Crefo" Creative Photography video and fashion club</h3>
	        <p>
              The Creative Photography Video and Fashion Club explores the connection between the eye, the camera, and the spirit by fostering the growth of artistic vision and technical knowledge. The Club provides an informal, friendly, and supportive environment for photographers at all levels of experience and with interests in all types of photographic imagery. The Club offers a means for members to share ideas and knowledge with each other, and promotes an interest in photography throughout campus by volunteering our time to take pictures for other organizations on campus that are in need of a photographer. We will be also promoting throughout the community through exhibitions and public events. At our weekly meetings we host speakers with diverse perspectives and skills in photography and, through photoshares, encourage the sharing and critiquing of members work. We are involved in community projects, and we will be having field trips scheduled throughout the year to provide interesting photo opportunities for members
